The rarity of scientists can effect the death chance as well how often a rare item shows up. Level can also play a factor of how often a rare item shows up. There are currently 4 rarities of scientists. Here's how each of the rarities effects the death chance for a excavation:\n\nCommon: No Death Chance reduction.\nUncommon: Lowers Death Chance by 10%.\nRare: Lowers Death Chance by 25%.\nLegendary: Lowers Death Chance by 50%.", ephemeral: shared })
